This software module is part of the project "SMIEAE: Intelligent Monitoring System for Stress and Anxiety in Students," which proposes an innovative solution to address the growing concern for students' mental health. By utilizing advanced monitoring and data analysis technologies, SMIEAE aims to proactively detect and manage cases of stress and anxiety.

The platform will integrate sensors, wearable devices, communication networks, mobile applications, and robust and reliable artificial intelligence algorithms within an Internet of Things (IoT) architecture to collect biometric data in real-time and perform behavioral analysis. This data analysis will identify patterns and early signs of stress and anxiety, enabling preventive interventions.

The SMIEAE system will be developed with a user-centered approach to ensure confidentiality and accessibility, providing students and academic authorities with effective tools, such as a dashboard, to manage students' emotional well-being. SMIEAE seeks not only to improve students' mental health but also to foster a healthier and more productive educational environment.
